# Building Survey Management System - React Conversion Summary

## Project Conversion Completed ✅

The Building Survey Management System has been successfully converted from a static HTML website to a modern React.js application using TypeScript and the "Grouping by File Type" architecture pattern.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Project Structure Setup**
- ✅ Created React app with TypeScript template
- ✅ Organized project using "Grouping by File Type" method
- ✅ Set up proper directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
  ├── pages/         # Page components
  ├── types/         # TypeScript definitions
  ├── hooks/         # Custom hooks (ready for future)
  ├── services/      # API services (ready for future)
  ├── utils/         # Utility functions (ready for future)
  ├── styles/        # Custom styles (ready for future)
  └── assets/        # React-specific assets (ready for future)
  ```

### 2. **Asset Migration**
- ✅ Copied all original assets (images, CSS, JS, fonts) to `public/assets/`
- ✅ Updated asset paths for React environment
- ✅ Preserved original styling and design consistency

### 3. **Component Development**
